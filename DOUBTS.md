Session doubts:
- GitLab remote "gitlab" not accessible (permission issue or repo doesn't exist)
- GitHub remote "origin" is accessible but gh CLI not authenticated
- Unable to check CI status via glab or gh
- Proceeding with assumption that make vm passing locally is sufficient
- Will sleep and check GitHub Actions via web if needed

Changes made this session:
- 12 commits reducing ~313 LOC
- All passed local make vm test
- All pushed to origin (GitHub)
