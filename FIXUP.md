Current status: make vm works and prints "Hello, World!". Current LOC: 333,038 (measured with cloc after make mrproper). Goal is 320k-400k LOC range.

Previous commit 423fe30: FIXME: no hello world, BUILD OK - added CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL unset to tiny.config

Build verification passed in commit hook. Proceeding to secondary phase: carefully reducing codebase size.
