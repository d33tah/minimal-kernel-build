Current status: make vm works and prints "Hello, World!". Current LOC: 343,450 (measured with cloc after make mrproper). Goal is 320k-400k LOC range. In secondary phase - need to reduce LOC towards 320k target.

Previous commit 30eaebe: FIXME: hello world working, BUILD OK - current LOC: 343,450 - removed writeback.h trace events file

Build verification passed. Continuing secondary phase: carefully reducing codebase size iteratively.
