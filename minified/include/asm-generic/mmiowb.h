/*
 * Generic implementation of mmiowb() tracking for spinlocks.
 *
 * If your architecture doesn't ensure that writes to an I/O peripheral
 * within two spinlocked sections on two different CPUs are seen by the
 * peripheral in the order corresponding to the lock handover, then you
 * need to follow these FIVE easy steps:
 *
 * 	1. Implement mmiowb() (and arch_mmiowb_state() if you're fancy)
 *	   in asm/mmiowb.h, then #include this file
 *	2. Ensure your I/O write accessors call mmiowb_set_pending()
 *	3. Select ARCH_HAS_MMIOWB
 *	4. Untangle the resulting mess of header files
 *	5. Complain to your architects
