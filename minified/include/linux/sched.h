 *
 * Support data structure to track an Exponential Weighted Moving Average
 * (EWMA) of a FAIR task's utilization. New samples are added to the moving
 * average each time a task completes an activation. Sample's weight is chosen
 * so that the EWMA will be relatively insensitive to transient changes to the
 * task's workload.
 *
 * The enqueued attribute has a slightly different meaning for tasks and cpus:
 * - task:   the task's util_avg at last task dequeue time
 * - cfs_rq: the sum of util_est.enqueued for each RUNNABLE task on that CPU
 * Thus, the util_est.enqueued of a task represents the contribution on the
 * estimated utilization of the CPU where that task is currently enqueued.
 *
 * Only for tasks we track a moving average of the past instantaneous
 * estimated utilization. This allows to absorb sporadic drops in utilization
 * of an otherwise almost periodic task.
 *
 * The UTIL_AVG_UNCHANGED flag is used to synchronize util_est with util_avg
 * updates. When a task is dequeued, its util_est should not be updated if its
 * util_avg has not been updated in the meantime.
 * This information is mapped into the MSB bit of util_est.enqueued at dequeue
 * time. Since max value of util_est.enqueued for a task is 1024 (PELT util_avg
 * for a task) it is safe to use MSB.
